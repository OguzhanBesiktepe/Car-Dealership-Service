Our software will be based on a Car Dealership Service Management System, which will allow workers to take customer information, look at repair history of customer owned vehicles, and track past services for their cars. 
This software will store basic customer information (including name, contact information, address), along with car information (VIN Number, Make/Model, & Mileage). 
To store this information we will be using Google Firebase Realtime Database. Along with this we will use JavaFX to demonstrate multiple customers (having multiple vehicles) and when they would need to schedule their next service appointments.
