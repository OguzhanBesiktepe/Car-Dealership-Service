## ✅ What did you accomplish since the last meeting?
- 🛠️ Set up basic user functionality for creating accounts and logging into the app.
- 🔒 Implemented a password reset screen that sends a reset link to the user's email.
- 🎨 Started basic styling for the app, including experimenting with colors and button designs.
- 🧩 Fixed an issue with merging into the `Main` branch, ensuring the latest code is accessible for all team members.

## 🚀 What will you work on today?
- 🔧 Fix the layout of the **ServiceQueue screen**, as it currently has a broken layout.
- 🌐 Integrate Firebase properly to work with all app elements.
- 🖌️ Refine the styling further, focusing on consistency and improving UI/UX.

## 🚧 What, if anything, is blocking your progress?
- ⚠️ The **ServiceQueue screen layout** issue is a major blocker that needs immediate attention.
- 🐛 Firebase integration still requires debugging to function correctly with existing app elements.
- 🤝 Coordination may be a challenge; everyone needs to share their changes on Discord before merging to prevent conflicts in the codebase.
